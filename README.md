# Project Title: "ListeningSpotlight" - A Music Streaming Service Analytics Dashboard 

_I'm a master of SQL, and I can communicate my results._

---
## Scenario : 
I am a data scientist and I like listening to music. I want to monitor my usage in order to 
1. identify artists I stream most,
2. my listening patterns, as in  
  2.1. the times i listen to music  
  2.2. the genres i mostly listen to  
3. how much time i spend on average on the application

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_This is a classic, high-value business problem._

### Why This Project:
1. Real-World Problem: It answers questions every subscription business asks: "Who are my users? Are they happy? Are they going to leave? How do i retain these users?"
2. Demonstrates SQL Mastery: The analysis requires more than simple GROUP BYs. I'll use complex joins, window functions, and CTEs (Common Table Expressions).
3. End-to-End Skills: I'm not just analyzing data; i'm creating it, storing it, querying it, and visualizing it. This is the full data lifecycle.
4. Interactive & Tangible: A user can actually click on and interact with the work, which is 1000x more impactful than a static notebook.

## The Tech Stack
1. Database: SQLite. It's serverless, file-based, and integrates perfectly with Python. No complex setup needed.
2. Backend/Analysis: Python (with libraries like Pandas, SQLAlchemy, and Spotify for data generation).
3. Frontend: javascript + typescript, react three js(interactivity)
